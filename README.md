**Author**: Yeajoon Yoo

## Business problem: This project was to help and determine which physiochemical properties make a good quality of Red Wine.

### Data:
[This data is from Red Wine Quality from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).


## Methods
- First Step: Loading & Filtering Data
- Second Step: Display Data Visualization such as ScatterPlot, Barplot, Correlation Hitmap.
- Last Step: Try various Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression and PCA-KNN Classification) to the data and find the best model for Red Wine Quality data.

## Results

#### Relationships between Sulphates and Quality

>When sulphates go higher, quality also becomes better.

>This data visualization shows that if alcohol has higher level, quality becomes better.

## Model

I have used Logistic Regression and PCA-KNN Classification model for this Red Wine data.
I can see that Logistic Regression Model has better score than KNN Classification.
