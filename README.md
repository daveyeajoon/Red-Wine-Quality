## Analyze the Red Wine Quality for Farmers and Customers

**Author**: Yeajoon Yoo

## Business problem: This project was to help and determine which physiochemical properties make a good quality of Red Wine.

### Data:
[This data is from Red Wine Quality from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).


## Methods
- First Step: Loading & Filtering Data
- Second Step: Display Data Visualization such as ScatterPlot, Barplot, Correlation Hitmap.
- Last Step: Try various Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression and PCA-KNN Classification) to the data and find the best model for Red Wine Quality data.

## Results

#### Relationships between Sulphates and Quality

>This data visualization shows that if alcohol has higher level, quality becomes better.

## Model

I have used PCA Logistic Regression and PCA KNN Regression model for this Red Wine data.
I would use Logistic Regression Model because this model showed much better score than KNN Regression to determine which model would get Good quality of Red Wine.
